It's often handy to have the camera at (0,0,0) pointing to negative z direction.
Coordinates like that are called "camera coordinates", and the usual coordinates
with camera being wherever it is pointing to wherever it points to are "world
coordinates". Both coordinate systems are right-handed with y axis pointing up.
