Given n intervals, we want an upper bound for how many non-overlapping intervals
they will be turned into.

Let f(n) denote the value that we want for this macro. Let's look at interval.c.
- If there is just one input interval, then the resulting array contains that
  interval unchanged.

	f(1) = 1

- If we add the n+1'th interval, then each of the n previous intervals can result
  in adding one more interval, and we also add the n+1'th interval:

	f(n+1) = f(n) + n + 1

f(n) can be solved from these equations.
