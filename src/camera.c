	The plane equation can be written as ax+by+cz = constant. By thinking of
	numbers as 1x1 matrices, we can write that as

		         _   _
		        |  x  |
		[a b c] |  y  | = constant.
		        |_ z _|

	How to apply a matrix to the plane? Consider the two planes that we should
	have before and after applying the matrix. A point is on the plane after
	applying the transform if and only if the INVERSE transformed point is on the
	plane before applying the transform. This means that to apply a matrix M, we
	should replace the equation with

		              _   _
		             |  x  |
		[a b c] M^-1 |  y  | = constant,
		             |_ z _|

	and from linear algebra, we know that

		                       _   _    T
		               /      |  a  | \
		[a b c] M^-1 = | M^-1 |  b  | |
		               \      |_ c _| /

	In this case, M is a matrix taking vectors from camera coordinates to world
	coordinates, so M^-1 is the world2cam matrix.
