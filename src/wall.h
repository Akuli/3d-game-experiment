I thought about doing collision checking by dividing it into these cases:
- The ellipsoid could touch the corner points of the wall.
- The ellipsoid could touch any edge of the wall so that it touches between the corners,
  and doesn't touch the corners.
- The ellipsoid could touch the "center part" of the wall without touching any edges or
  corners.

Handling all this would be a lot of code, so instead we just spread some points
uniformly across the wall and see if those touch. I call these collision points.
