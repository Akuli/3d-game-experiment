# Putting games on USB sticks is handy for sharing them with friends. Everyone
# uses Windows, so this makes a Window build of the game and puts it to a USB
# stick.
#
# Usage:
#
#   $ sudo apt install wine
#   $ make clean
#   $ scripts/to_usb_stick '/media/<user>/<usb stick name>'
#
# You can skip 'make clean' if you don't have obj/ files from non-Windows builds.

set -ex
[ $# -eq 1 ]        # if this fails, you forgot the argument to the script
dest="$1"

(source winbuildenv && make -j2 build/game.exe)

# I couldn't get rsync to do the right thing, so here we go...
